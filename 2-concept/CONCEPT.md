# Concept description

## _TITLE_ and description of the app

The title of our app is TripGen. Our app generates travel itineraries based on the location and number of days a user inputs. It has several features such as user recommendations, finding the cheapest attraction prices, travel tips, and a bucket list.

## _WHO_ are the users you have in mind? (Add specifics or characteristics of the users) (> 50 words)

The users we have in mind are individuals who love traveling. The characteristics include individuals over the age of 16 who are adventorous and have a keen interest exploring new cultures and visiting interesting places. Also people who do not know where to start, people who may have a hard time organizing a trip.

## _WHAT_ problem will the app help the users to solve? (Describe various use cases) (> 50 words)

When visiting a new country, every traveler wants to get the best experience for the duration of their trip. Sometimes, figuring out what to do during your trip requires extensive and careful planning. This is where we come in and help the consumer. We generate the best travel itineraries based on the duration of their trip. In addition, it is not limited to our suggestions, users can upload their own custom trips where other users can rate them out of 5 and use these as well.

## _HOW_ are users solving the problem now? (Without your app) (> 75 words)

Users are relying on multiple sources to come up with a travel itinerary. For example, users will use Google and websites like tripadvisor and spend significant amounts of time to compile an itinerary. We come in and make people's lives better and easier as we remove that time constraint.

## _HOW_ can the users solve the problem with your app? (> 75 words)

Users can solve the problem with our app by not having to worry about planning an entire trip themselves and also browsing several websites to determine what to visit. In addition, our app offers live ticket prices to many events. For example, if our travel itinerary suggests a museum to visit, it will display live ticket prices for that musuem, making it extremely convenient for our users.
